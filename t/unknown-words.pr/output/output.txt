<details><summary>To accept these unrecognized words as correct and remove the previously acknowledged and now absent words,
you could run the following commands</summary>

... in a clone of the [GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME](GITHUB_SERVER_URL/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME) repository
on the `GITHUB_BRANCH` branch ([:information_source: how do I use this?](
https://docs.check-spelling.dev/Accepting-Suggestions)):

``` sh
git fetch 'GITHUB_SERVER_URL/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME' refs/heads/'some-base':refs/private/check-spelling-merge-base &&
git checkout 'some-head' &&
git merge -m 'Merge some-base' 'refs/private/check-spelling-merge-base' &&

git commit -m 'Update check-spelling metadata'
```
</details>

<details><summary>Forbidden patterns :no_good: (1)</summary>

In order to address this, you could change the content to not match the forbidden patterns (comments before forbidden patterns may help explain why they're forbidden), add patterns for acceptable instances, or adjust the forbidden patterns themselves.

These forbidden patterns matched content:

#### Should be `sample-file.txt`
```
\bsample\.file\b
```

</details>

<details><summary>Errors and Warnings :x: (3)</summary>

#### See the [:scroll:action log](GITHUB_SERVER_URL/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER/GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME/actions/runs/GITHUB_RUN_ID) or :memo: job summary for details.
