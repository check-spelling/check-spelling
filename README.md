# @check-spelling/check-spelling GitHub Action

## Overview

Everyone makes typos. This includes people writing documentation and comments,
but it also includes programmers naming variables, functions, APIs, classes,
and filenames.

Often, programmers will use `InitialCapitalization`, `camelCase`,
`ALL_CAPS`, or `IDLCase` when naming their things. When they do this, it makes
it much harder for naive spelling tools to recognize misspellings, and as such,
with a really high false-positive rate, people don't tend to enable spell checking
at all.

This repository's tools are capable of tolerating all of those variations.
Specifically, [w](https://github.com/jsoref/spelling/blob/master/w) understands
enough about how programmers name things that it can split the above conventions
into word-like things for checking against a dictionary.

### How check-spelling approaches content

Input | Seen | Reported | Explanation
-|-|-|-
`InitialCapitalization`|`Initial` `Capitalization`| `` | Both words are in the dictionary
`camelCase`|`camel` `Case`| `` | Both words are in the dictionary
`ALL_CAPS`|`ALL` `CAPS`| `` | Both words are in the dictionary
`IDLCase`| `IDL` `Case`| `IDL` | The first word isn't in the dictionary, but the second is

## Quick Setup

Just copy the [spell-check-this](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this)
[`.github/workflows/spelling.yml`](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/tree/main/.github/workflows/spelling.yml) into your `.github/workflows` in your project.

## Configuration

See the [documentation](https://docs.check-spelling.dev) for [Configuration information](https://docs.check-spelling.dev/Configuration).

## Events

When check-spelling runs and encounters something that isn't ideal,
it may output a message including an event code,
at the end of the message `(unrecognized-spelling)`.

You should be able to look up the code in
https://docs.check-spelling.dev/Event-descriptions.
For `unrecognized-spelling`,
that's:
https://docs.check-spelling.dev/Event-descriptions#unrecognized-spelling.

## Multilingual

As of [v0.0.22](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.22), you can [use non English dictionaries](https://docs.check-spelling.dev/Feature%3A-Configurable-word-characters) with the help of [Hunspell](https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell).

## Wiki

There is a [wiki](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki) containing evolving information. It's open to public editing (and is occasionally defaced/spammed).
